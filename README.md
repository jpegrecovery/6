# JPEG Recovery Pro 6

Sometimes the JPEG photos may be accidentially deleted from a memory card. There are tools to recover the deleted photos, however, sometime the results are quite strange e.g. there is a portion of other photo in between the photo. Sometimes the JPEG picture may have color shift after copying, moving, etc. Sometimes just due to unknown reasons your JPEG pictures cannot be opened.

The primary objective of JPEG Recovery is to recover your picture by examining the valid JPEG data inside the picture.
